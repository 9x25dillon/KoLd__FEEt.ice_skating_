# Hand-off

**Last session: 2026-09-08 → 09. Repo state: complete specification, plus one running implementation.**

Read this before touching anything. It covers what exists, what is decided, the conventions that
hold the document set together, and the things most likely to trip you up.

> **This line changed.** Until 2026-09-08 this file said *"zero implementation."* That is no longer
> true: `tools/ice-lab/` is real, runs, and has 56 passing tests. Nothing else has been built.

## 1 · What this is

**Edgework** — a physics-first figure skating simulation. Mostly design specification; the first
code is a tuning rig, not the game. The repo is a complete plan for a 30-month, ~$11.9M production,
plus the machine-readable data and reference implementations that plan depends on, plus a browser
rig for tuning the blade–ice model before it is written in C++.

Owner: [@9x25dillon](https://github.com/9x25dillon). Public repo. Dual-licensed — see
[README](README.md#licensing), and **do not relicense without asking**: the split (docs
CC BY-NC-ND, code/data Apache-2.0) is deliberate and reasoned.

## 2 · Current state

| | |
| --- | --- |
| Documents | 8 in `docs/`, all complete |
| Data files | 12 in `data/` — 5 CSV, 6 JSON, 1 README |
| Reference code | 6 files in `src/reference/` — specifications-as-code, do not compile |
| Engineering material | `big_reffg.txt` — 3,711 lines, three concatenated documents, **has known defects, see §2.2** |
| Implementation | `tools/ice-lab/` — 3,002 lines, 56 tests, zero dependencies |
| Rendered pages | 5, published as Artifacts **and** mirrored in `docs/web/` |
| Decisions | **4 of 6 closed.** D1 and D5 remain |

### The two open decisions — and they are one conversation

**D1 (budget/team)** and **D5 (disciplines at launch)** are coupled. The plan totals **$11.9M of
development**; D1's envelope quotes **$18–25M**. If that envelope is development-only, there is
~$6M of headroom, and the honest place to spend it is the second discipline D5 asks about. If it
includes marketing and year-one liveops, the plan fits as written. **Resolve them together, with
whoever holds the money in the room.**

### Decisions closed 2026-09-03 (previous session)

| | Decision | Note |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **D2** | Unreal Engine 5.4+ | Cancelled the pre-production bake-off; W1–2 became a single-engine validation spike |
| **D3** | Single-player first | Default; async ghosts + warm-up lobby at launch, pairs year one |
| **D4** | Adaptive tier routing | *Not* either option the register offered — The Patch recommends a tier from its own tracing score |
| **D6** | No athlete licensing | Closed at first writing |

**D2 is closed and stays closed.** It was raised again on 2026-09-09 as "should we build a game
engine" and the answer was no, for the reason the register itself gives: it was the only item with
a hard date, and every week it stayed open cost two engineers half their throughput. If a session
is asked to build an engine, say what D2 says and offer the Ice Lab route instead.

## 2.1 · `tools/ice-lab/` — what it is and how to run it

A 120 Hz, deterministic, **inertial** implementation of the blade–ice model with every constant on
a slider. It is EDGE-019's Ice Lab, built early and cheap, so `KoLdSimCore` can be written in C++ as
transcription rather than as discovery. **It is not the game and it is not an engine.**

```sh
cd tools/ice-lab
node --test test/*.test.ts     # 56 pass, ~1.9 s
node app/serve.mjs             # http://localhost:8123/
```

**Zero dependencies, and keep it that way.** Node 26 strips TypeScript natively and exposes the
stripper as an API (`node:module` → `stripTypeScriptTypes`), which is the entire build step. The
price is **erasable syntax only** — no `enum`, no `namespace`, no constructor parameter properties.
`test/boundary.test.ts` enforces that, and also enforces the rule the UE5 port depends on: `sim/`
never imports `app/`, never touches the DOM, a clock, or `Math.random`.

`tsconfig.json` exists for editors and an optional `tsc --noEmit`. It is the only thing in the rig
that wants anything installed. Tests and build do not need it.

Read [`tools/ice-lab/README.md`](tools/ice-lab/README.md) before changing any of it.

### What the rig found

Six things, each recorded as a test rather than prose, so they fail loudly if reverted.

1. **`big_reffg.txt` contains both readings of the handedness.** One half correctly calls `Up × t`
   "the skater's left"; the other calls the identical expression "Right" and derives every edge
   code from it. Mirror images — one names an RFO where the other names an RFI. A takeoff-edge
   validator on the wrong one fails every jump in `data/jump-definitions.csv` while looking
   self-consistent. Settled in `sim/math.ts`; checked against every CSV row in
   `test/classify.test.ts`.
2. **The internal balance authority has its sign backwards.** A positive balance error needs a
   *positive* `a_int` to arrest it. As specified, arms and free leg push the skater further over.
3. **The two-blade lateral solve cannot pass its own acceptance test.** Full body mass per blade,
   applied Gauss-Seidel, so the first blade absorbs everything. Fixed — which surfaces a model
   fact: with capacity linear in load, both blades sit at *identical* demand ratios, so the weight
   split can never decide which lets go without sublinear capacity, which is not in the model.
4. **The specified gains cannot enter a deep edge from upright.** Holding 20° at 4 m/s is stable;
   reaching it is not. Measured, deepest lean reachable from upright:

   | | 3 m/s | 4 m/s | 6 m/s |
   |---|---|---|---|
   | `spec` (Kd 8, angulation 20°) | — | **11°** | — |
   | `responsive` (Kd 16, angulation 40°) | 13° | **26°** | 46° |

   Neither change suffices alone. The table also carries the best thing the model says about the
   game: **speed buys depth**, far more than gains do.
5. **An assist tier that raises recovery authority makes balance worse.** `internalMax` 1.5 → 2.5
   falls at tick 77 instead of 527, and 2.0 outlasts 1.5 — a proportional gain with no damping.
6. **Four mechanisms the package lacks**: variable effective rocker along the blade; lateral
   resistance on a flat blade; a rate-limited knee; and rotating rather than projecting velocity
   under the constraint.

**`DEFAULT_PARAMS` stays faithful to the spec so the defects remain measurable.** Working values
live in `PRESETS.responsive`. Do not "fix" the defaults — that hides the finding.

## 2.2 · `big_reffg.txt` — read this before trusting it

Committed unedited on 2026-09-09 (`1a0fa55`) because it is the source the Ice Lab was built against.
It is **three separate documents concatenated**, not one:

| line | document |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | Edgework Subsystem: Engineering Package v0.1 — `KoldSim`, 48 B blade, 16 B input, balance external |
| 636 | First 50 Engineering Tasks, KOLD-001..050 |
| 2502 | Edgework Build Package, EDGE-000..019 — `KoLdSimCore`, 80 B blade, 8 B input, balance integrated |

Known defects:

- **The first and third are incompatible designs sharing a name** — different modules, struct sizes
  and layouts, input quantization, and disagreeing on whether the solver owns balance or reports it.
- **They disagree on handedness** (see §2.1).
- **The 50-task list contradicts itself**: KOLD-012/013 give 48 B blade + 56 B body while KOLD-014
  asks for 256 B total (the sum is 152), and KOLD-015 says 16 B input where the third package says 8.
- **§6.2's classifier is truncated.** The `.cpp` stops mid-function at line 630, `if (F.bLobeOpen)`,
  and line 631 is prose from the second document. `FKoldEdgeClassifier::Update` has no body.
- **Its "repository unavailable, PENDING AUDIT" premise is stale.** `data/jump-definitions.csv`,
  `data/assist-tiers.json`, `data/step-features.json` and `src/reference/` answer most of its open
  questions directly, and D2 closed the engine question on 2026-09-03.
- **Where its ASSUMPTION values disagree with the design bible and `src/reference/SkateSolver.cpp`,
  the bible wins**: rocker 2.05 not 2.2/2.4, μ_skid 0.35 not 0.03, max lean 1.13 not 1.05/0.96.

## 3 · Conventions that hold the set together

Break these and the repo stops being coherent. They are not arbitrary.

### 3.1 Markdown is the source of truth; HTML is the rendering

Every phase and system document exists twice: `docs/*.md` (reviewable, diffable, PR-commentable)
and `docs/web/*.html` (the published Artifact). **Edit the markdown first, then mirror.** They
will drift if you do it the other way round.

### 3.2 Scoring is data, never code

The ISU revises its Scale of Values most seasons. Everything scoring-related lives in `data/` so a
rules change is a data patch shipped in days. **Never inline a base value, a threshold, or a level
feature into code.** See [`data/README.md`](data/README.md).

### 3.3 Every threshold is a balance lever, not a rule

Where the ISU says *"clear increase of speed"*, a human specialist applies judgement and a game
must pick a number. We picked 1.30. **Label these as design decisions wherever they surface** —
`data/spin-features.json` and `step-features.json` both carry this warning in their headers, and
`verified_against_isu: false` is set honestly. Do not quietly flip that flag.

### 3.4 Gate criteria are pre-commitments

Every phase gate has thresholds **signed before the data exists** — that is what stops a gate
becoming theatre. If you add a gate, add its sign-off date too.

### 3.5 Corrections are recorded, not silently applied

Three places the later documents deliberately correct the bible. Preserve these notes:

| Correction | Where |
| --- | --- |
| The Composer searches a **motion-primitive lattice in physics space**, not the motion-matching database | [composer-solver.md §2](docs/composer-solver.md#2--why-this-is-hard) |
| Mocap blocks 1 and 2 moved to the **vertical slice**; production gets a third, smaller block | [production-plan.md §6](docs/production-plan.md#6--mocap-block-3) |
| `spin-step-values.csv` gained the missing **level B** rows | commit `9de53a4` |

---

## 4 · Published Artifacts

Five live pages. **URLs are stable — always update in place, never republish as new.**

| Page | Artifact URL | Repo mirror |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Design bible | `claude.ai/code/artifact/58f6234d-6ece-4f55-8fc5-2b7a7ce86da9` | `docs/web/index.html` |
| Pre-production | `claude.ai/code/artifact/531a5952-fcfd-44bf-966a-ae31ce3562c9` | `docs/web/pre-production.html` |
| Vertical slice | `claude.ai/code/artifact/dde9b2ad-4d31-412f-a15e-6edbb6cc305a` | `docs/web/vertical-slice.html` |
| Production | `claude.ai/code/artifact/6a36f22c-3ed6-4439-828b-cd14759ebaca` | `docs/web/production.html` |
| Beta | `claude.ai/code/artifact/bdd4ebbf-b24e-4b31-bcf3-9afdce6a4e53` | `docs/web/beta.html` |

### To update one from a new session

1. Edit the markdown in `docs/`.
2. Edit the mirror in `docs/web/`.
3. Publish **passing the `url` parameter** from the table above. Without it you create a *second*
   artifact instead of updating the existing one.

The mirrors in `docs/web/` exist precisely so a new session never needs the previous session's
scratchpad — which does not survive.

### Shared visual identity

All five pages use one stylesheet: Bodoni Moda (display) × IBM Plex Sans (body) × IBM Plex Mono
(data), cool grey-white ground, arena-amber accent `#9c6b12` / `#e2a94e`, steel-teal `#2c6773` for
data, double-hairline section rules echoing a blade tracing. **The bible's stylesheet is the
richest** (it has the syntax-highlighting classes); the four plans share a slightly reduced one.
If you add a sixth page, copy the head from `docs/web/production.html`.

## 5 · Things that will trip you up

**Documents and shell**

1. **The shell is `fish`.** Heredocs (`cat > f <<'EOF'` and `python3 - <<'PY'`) work fine through
   the Bash tool and were used throughout both sessions. What differs is **globbing**: an unmatched
   glob is a hard error, not a pass-through — `ls LICENSE*` fails with *"no matches found"* rather
   than printing nothing. Quote globs you are not certain match.

2. **Do not write HTML entities into source files.** `src/reference/SpinResolver.cpp` was written
   with `&amp;` and `&lt;` and needed an unescape pass. If you have just been authoring an HTML
   page, consciously switch modes before writing a `.cpp`.

3. **Exact-match edits fail across the md/HTML pair.** The same sentence is line-wrapped
   differently — e.g. `None, no HUD` (markdown) vs `None, no HUD at all` (HTML). **Grep the target
   file for the actual string before constructing the edit.**

**The Ice Lab**

4. **Erasable syntax only.** An `enum`, a `namespace`, or a constructor parameter property compiles
   under an IDE and then fails at `node app/build.mjs`. `test/boundary.test.ts` catches all three —
   run the tests before assuming a change is fine.

5. **A skater with no propulsion always falls, and it looks like a controller bug.** Speed decays
   through friction and drag, the maximum holdable lean falls as `κ = g·tan φ / v²`, and eventually
   any commanded lean is unholdable. Roughly five seconds from 5 m/s. **Before debugging the balance
   loop, check the speed at the moment of the fall** — an afternoon went into gain sweeps that a
   single speed trace would have ended. Test sequences must either stroke (`push: true` every ~90
   ticks) or disable losses.

6. **Measure before asserting.** Several tests were written with guessed bounds and had to be
   loosened to the measured value. Print the number first, then write the assertion around it —
   otherwise a passing test is only recording the guess that happened to be generous enough.

7. **Piping a long background command to `tail` hides it.** `npm test | tail` in the background
   produces an empty output file until the command exits, which reads exactly like a hang. Give
   long runs a generous timeout and read the raw output file, not a filtered tail.

---

## 6 · Where to go next

In descending order of value:

1. **Close D1 and D5 together.** Everything else is downstream of the money. Unchanged.
2. **Fix what the Ice Lab found, in the rig, before any C++ is written.** The balance controller
   cannot enter a deep edge from upright at stroking speed (§2.1 finding 4) and the internal
   authority term needs a rate component before any assist tier can raise it (finding 5). Both are
   cheap here and expensive later.
3. **Take the rig to a skater.** It renders edges, carve circles, force vectors, the equilibrium
   lean and a live tracing, and exports per-tick CSV. The question the whole project is downstream
   of — §7 below — is now answerable by someone who skates, on a laptop, in an afternoon. Record
   the session in `docs/tuning/` and export the parameter set with the panel's **params.json**
   button, which emits only what differs from `spec`.
4. **Then port `sim/` to `KoLdSimCore`.** It is written to be transcribed: SI throughout, plain
   data, no allocation in `step`, every transcendental through one module, truncating checksums,
   and an edge code whose spelling already matches `data/jump-definitions.csv`.
5. **Verify the ISU data.** `spin-features.json`, `step-features.json` and `scale-of-values.csv`
   are faithful models, not transcriptions, and all carry `verified_against_isu: false`.
6. **Build the protocol validation corpus** — 50 published elements reconstructed against the level
   detector, target ≥85% agreement. Needs Composer v0, so it belongs to the vertical slice.

### Not in the rig, deliberately

Turns and three-turns, spins, jumps, airborne flight, stamina, flow, animation, audio, networking,
and ice-grid feedback — tracings are drawn but do not yet feed friction or bite back into the
solver as the bible's §05 requires. The stroke is the bible's semi-analytic push, not a leg model.

### Known gaps, all deliberate

Tracked at the foot of [open-decisions.md](docs/open-decisions.md): balance-model tuning constants
(**the Ice Lab is now the instrument for these** — they were "cannot be derived, they come from the
feel prototype"), crowd reaction propagation timing, career economy, and ice temperature as a
career variable.

---

## 7 · The one thing that matters most

Everything in this repo is downstream of a single unproven claim: **that analog lean plus analog
knee pressure is a good primary verb.** No shipped game has used it.

There is a real kill gate at pre-production week 16 — *"is carving fun with no jumps, no score and
no art?"* — with pre-committed thresholds, a decision-maker who is **not** the person who invented
the scheme, and the authority to stop the project.

If a future session is asked to soften that gate, move its thresholds after seeing data, or let the
creative lead vote on it — **push back.** Those three properties are the only reason the gate is
worth having.

## 8 · Session log

| date | what happened |
| --- | --- |
| 2026-09-02 → 03 | Specification completed. D2, D3, D4, D6 closed. Five Artifacts published and mirrored. |
| 2026-09-08 → 09 | `big_reffg.txt` reviewed and committed with its defects recorded. `tools/ice-lab/` built, 56 tests. Six defects found in the engineering package, each captured as a test. D2 re-raised and re-closed. Merged as PR #1 (`fbbf83c`). |

### How the 2026-09-09 session ran, for whoever runs the next one

The shape that worked: **assess first, recommend once, then build.** The session opened as a
review of `big_reffg.txt`, pivoted to "can this other repo become a game engine", and the useful
move was to answer the question that was asked, then say plainly that the obvious next step
collided with a closed decision — rather than either building the wrong thing or refusing.

Two habits worth keeping:

- **Check the repo before believing a document about the repo.** `big_reffg.txt` declares its own
  repository access UNKNOWN and marks everything PENDING AUDIT. The data files were sitting right
  there and answered most of it in about five minutes.
- **When a spec and the project's own reference code disagree, say which wins and why, in the
  code.** `sim/params.ts` carries that table as a comment. Nobody has to re-derive it.
